# Instructor Version

For the instructor notebook:

- Include **complete, working code** for all examples
- Add detailed explanatory comments in the code
- Show expected outputs clearly
- Include edge cases and variations where relevant
- Make code production-ready and well-documented
- Add `print()` statements to demonstrate results

The instructor version should serve as:
- A reference implementation students can compare against
- Teaching material with clear explanations
- Demonstration of best practices
