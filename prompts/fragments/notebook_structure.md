# Notebook Structure

Follow a strict **Markdown → Code** cell pattern throughout:

* Each **Markdown cell**:
  * Introduces one focused concept
  * Provides a clear explanation
  * Ends with instructions for the learner about what to notice or do in the following code cell

* Each **Code cell**:
  * Contains working Python code that illustrates the concept
  * Includes clear comments explaining key steps
