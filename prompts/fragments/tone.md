# Tone

The tone in **Markdown cells** should be:

* Clear, concise, and conversational
* Like an instructor speaking in class:
  * "Now let's see what happens if..."
  * "Try changing this value to..."
  * "Run this cell and observe the output."

* Avoid:
  * Dense blocks of prose
  * Overly formal documentation style
  * Unnecessary jargon

* Use:
  * Short paragraphs
  * Bullet points when helpful
  * Concrete instructions ("Modify this line...", "Add a condition here...")
