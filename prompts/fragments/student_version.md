# Student Version Guidelines

For the **student notebook**, create a version where students actively participate:

* Code cells should have **key parts left incomplete** (marked with `....`)
* Students should fill in:
  * Key expressions
  * Function bodies or critical lines
  * Core control-flow structures
  * Important parameters

* Do **not** force students to type:
  * Long boilerplate sections
  * Verbose print() formatting
  * Repetitive plot labeling
  * Data-loading configuration blocks

Keep the typing load **small and focused** on conceptually important code.
