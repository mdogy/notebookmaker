# Student Version

For the student notebook:

- Provide code **scaffolding** with TODOs for students to complete
- Leave key implementation parts for students to fill in
- Include helpful hints in comments (but don't give away the solution)
- Guide students toward the solution without showing it directly
- Mark incomplete sections with `# TODO: ...` comments
- Provide structure so students know what to implement

The student version should:
- Challenge students to think through the implementation
- Provide enough guidance to avoid frustration
- Allow students to learn by doing
- Build confidence through successful completion
