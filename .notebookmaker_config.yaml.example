# NotebookMaker Configuration
#
# This configuration file specifies API keys for LLM providers used by NotebookMaker
# to analyze lecture materials and generate interactive Jupyter notebooks.
#
# Installation:
# 1. Copy this file to your home directory:
#    cp .notebookmaker_config.yaml.example ~/.notebookmaker_config.yaml
#
# 2. Edit ~/.notebookmaker_config.yaml and add your API keys
#
# 3. Protect the file (recommended):
#    chmod 600 ~/.notebookmaker_config.yaml
#
# Security Notes:
# - NEVER commit ~/.notebookmaker_config.yaml to version control
# - Keep API keys secure and never share them
# - The file should be readable only by you (chmod 600)

# API Keys
# Add your API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.
# You only need keys for the providers you plan to use.

# Anthropic Claude API Key
# Get your key at: https://console.anthropic.com/
# The key should start with "sk-ant-"
anthropic_api_key: "your-anthropic-key-here"

# Google Gemini API Key
# Get your key at: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
# NotebookMaker requires an explicit API key; ADC is not needed.
google_api_key: "your-google-key-here"

# OpenAI API Key
# Get your key at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# The key should start with "sk-"
openai_api_key: "your-openai-key-here"

# OpenRouter API Key
# Get your key at: https://openrouter.ai/keys
# The key should start with "sk-or-"
openrouter_api_key: "your-openrouter-key-here"

# Optional: LLM Provider Selection
# Uncomment and configure to override default provider/model selection
# If not specified, NotebookMaker will use the first available provider
# based on which API keys are configured

# Single-phase mode (legacy - uses same LLM for everything):
# llm:
#   provider: "anthropic"  # Options: anthropic, google, openai, openrouter
#   model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
#   max_tokens: 4000
#   temperature: 0.3

# Two-phase mode (recommended - separate LLMs for analysis and generation):
# Phase 1 analyzes PDF with vision capabilities to extract code/equations
# Phase 2 generates focused notebooks from the analysis

# RECOMMENDED: Use Gemini 2.0 Flash for both phases (multimodal + fast)
analysis:
  provider: "google"
  model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"  # Multimodal: supports image input
  max_tokens: 2000
  temperature: 0.3

generation:
  provider: "google"
  model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"  # Can use same or different model
  max_tokens: 16000
  temperature: 0.3

# Alternative configurations for two-phase mode:

# Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for both (excellent vision + reasoning):
# analysis:
#   provider: "anthropic"
#   model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"  # Multimodal
#   max_tokens: 2000
#   temperature: 0.3
# generation:
#   provider: "anthropic"
#   model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
#   max_tokens: 16000
#   temperature: 0.3

# Use different models for each phase (cost optimization):
# analysis:
#   provider: "anthropic"
#   model: "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"  # Fast, cheap, multimodal
#   max_tokens: 2000
#   temperature: 0.3
# generation:
#   provider: "anthropic"
#   model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"  # Better quality for generation
#   max_tokens: 16000
#   temperature: 0.3

# Use GPT-4o for both phases:
# analysis:
#   provider: "openai"
#   model: "gpt-4o"  # Excellent vision capabilities
#   max_tokens: 2000
#   temperature: 0.3
# generation:
#   provider: "openai"
#   model: "gpt-4o-mini"  # Cheaper alternative for generation
#   max_tokens: 16000
#   temperature: 0.3

# Optional: Logging Configuration
# logging:
#   level: "INFO"  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
#   log_llm_details: false  # Set to true to log API request/response details
